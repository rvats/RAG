How many of you have watched Iron Man? Today we are going to be on a journey to build the Iron Man's AI assistant Jarvis. 
That will be a good task but this could be a start. Good Morning Everyone. 
Large Language Models in AI, they are everywhere. They get something amazingly right and other things very interestingly wrong. 
My name is Rahul Vats. I am a manager in Microsoft practice under DET at EY. I am currently working on the Copilot Project at Microsoft. 
Today I am going to tell you about a framework/architecture that helps LLM be more accurate and more up to date. 
That framework/architecture is Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG. 
Generation refers to LLM which generate texts in response to a user query. 
There are 2 problem with LLM responses as we received from ChatGPT for example. One is there is no source and second is that the response often is out of date. 
These problem can be addressed by adding the Retrieval Augmented component to the Generation component of LLM models. 
Retrieval Augmented is basically a content store to our LLM model (The Generation Component)
